                                <p>
                                        Considering that 60% of the world’s fresh water is used for irrigation, there is
                                        an unmet need for implementation of better and sustainable irrigation schemes.
                                        As of today, remote sensing technology is based on thermal imagery or
                                        multispectral imaging, both techniques are limited in their detection accuracy.
                                        This study offers an interdisciplinary approach combining better-resolved
                                        sensors, plant physical characteristics and machine learning algorithms. We
                                        develop a computer-controlled feedback loop that will assess the water content
                                        of crops and tune precise irrigation. Results of the project will yield an
                                        artificial intelligence engine with the sole purpose to irrigate correctly and
                                        responsibly each part within the field, thus providing a substantial competition
                                        in the multimillion dollars market of precision irrigation.
